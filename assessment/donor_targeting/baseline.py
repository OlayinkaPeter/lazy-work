"""Precision and recall of the business-as-usual email rule vs targeting with the centroid.

BAU sends every email to a random 75% of the active list. Because history was sent to a random
75%, the sends we observed are an unbiased sample of the whole list, so any targeting rule can
be replayed on them. For each email we keep a share of its recipients and measure:

* precision   - share of emailed people who donated (attributed within 7 days)
* recall      - share of donors (who would have given had everyone been emailed) still reached
* $ recall    - the same, weighted by donation amount
* unsub share - share of unsubscribes still caused (lower is better: this is the churn)

The centroid rule ranks each email's recipients by `centroid_cosine_similarity` (people with
no engagement in the last 30 days last) and keeps the top k%.

    python -m donor_targeting.baseline    # prints the table, writes reports/baseline_report.md
